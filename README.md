Manage system config files / dotfiles

Inspired from this blogpost by Nicola Paolucci https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles, I want to track my dotfiles using this git repo and a separate branch for each system. 

---- 
## Requirements



- Git
- Curl

## Install

Install config tracking in your $HOME by running:

curl -Lks https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alexg9010/dotfiles/master/dotfiles-install | bash
