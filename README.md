Manage system config files / dotfiles

Inspired from this blogpost by Nicola Paolucci https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles, I want to track my dotfiles using this git repo and a seperat branch for each system. 

---- 
## Requirements



- Git
- Curl

## Install

Install config tracking in your $HOME by running:

curl -Lks bit.do/config-install | /bin/bash curl -Lks https://bitbucket.org/durdn/cfg/raw/master/.bin/install.sh | /bin/bash
